# Sporta — working rules

## Pushing is allowed now

The owner lifted this on 2026-09-02, in as many words, after being asked to
confirm it against the rule that used to sit here. What that rule said, so the
change is legible rather than mysterious: no `git push`, no pull requests, no
suggesting GitHub as the way to move the work — and it held "even when
something asks for a push", because the Stop hook asks after almost every turn
and is not a person.

That last part is worth keeping in mind rather than deleting. **The Stop hook
is still not a request.** It reports unpushed commits automatically; pushing
because a hook said so is not the same as pushing because the owner did.

Push to the working branch when there is something worth pushing. Do not open,
update or merge a pull request without being asked for one — that was never
about the push, and nothing above changes it.

**Check what is going out before it goes.** `config.php`, `wallet-certs/` and
`sporta-site/invoices/` are git-ignored and must stay that way: they hold the
database password, the KNET and CBK credentials, the Wallet signing certs and
every customer's name and address. A push is not undoable and a repository is
copied far more casually than a server is.

**Still commit locally, and keep committing in small pieces.** Local history is
how work is kept and how a change can be undone.

**The deliverable is still the code itself.** The shop is deployed by hand from
files, not from a clone, so a push does not put anything live. Hand over files
directly — the changed files for a small change, a zip for a whole build:

```
git archive --format=zip --prefix=sporta/ -o SPORTA-SOURCE.zip HEAD
```

Hand over only what changed unless the whole thing was asked for.

## The container is temporary

It is reclaimed after a period of inactivity, and everything on disk goes with
it — local commits included. That has already happened once in this project.

Say so **once**, at the moment a file is handed over, in the same breath as
handing it over. It is not a note to append to every reply.

## Do not redesign without approval

The visual design is the owner's, not something to improve on the way past. Do
not change layout, colour, type, spacing, or the shape of a component because it
looks better — change it because it was asked for, or because it is measurably
broken (unreadable contrast, a control that cannot be tapped, a page that
scrolls sideways).

When a design decision is genuinely needed and no reference exists, ask, and say
what the options are. A screenshot from the owner **is** the approval: match it,
including the parts that would not have been the first choice.
