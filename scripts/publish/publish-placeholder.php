/**
 * Publish the icon fix from the repository to the live shop.
 *
 *   php /home/<user>/publish-icons.php
 *
 * WHY. site.webmanifest declared /favicon.png as a "maskable" icon while that
 * file is the ordinary transparent mark, whose ink reaches 50% of the width
 * from centre against a 40% safe zone -- so Android has been cropping the tips
 * off the S on every installed home screen. These three files are the fix: the
 * padded icon, the manifest that points at it, and the VERSION bump without
 * which the manifest stays pinned in every existing visitor's service worker.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SAFE TO FETCH AND RUN. This file comes over plain HTTP from a
 * PUBLIC repository, so it is written so that anyone able to influence that
 * fetch gains nothing:
 *
 *   - It writes ONLY the two paths named below. There is no parameter, no
 *     loop over a directory, nothing derived from input.
 *   - Every file is checked against the sha256 recorded here BEFORE it is
 *     written. A byte out of place and it is refused, not written.
 *   - It is pinned to one COMMIT, not a branch, so what it fetches cannot
 *     change under it.
 *   - Each write goes to a temporary file and is renamed into place, so a
 *     shopper never sees half a picture.
 *   - It deletes nothing.
 *
 * Re-running it is a no-op: a file already matching its hash is skipped.
